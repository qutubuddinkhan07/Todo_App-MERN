# 📝 Full-Stack Todo List App with Redux Toolkit & MongoDB

This is a full-stack Todo List application built with **React**, **Redux Toolkit**, **Express**, and **MongoDB**. It allows users to:

- Add, delete, and mark tasks as done/undone
- View all tasks in a scrollable, responsive UI
- See task creation time and date
- Automatically sync tasks with a MongoDB database
- Display a message or image when no tasks are present

The backend uses **Express.js** to expose RESTful APIs for managing todos, while the frontend uses **React** with **Tailwind CSS** for a modern, mobile-friendly UI. State is managed efficiently using **Redux Toolkit**.

> This project demonstrates a clean full-stack implementation with proper folder structure, async data fetching, and user-friendly UI/UX.
